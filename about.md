I work at a company called [Codit](http://www.codit.eu), doing integration work. That probably is just void() for you, but let's just say we make applications talk to other applications.

My interests are mainly .NET focused, however I'm always open for any interesting technology.

In case you're interested in the code I write, please visit my [Github profile](http://www.github.com/samneirinck). Happy reading.
